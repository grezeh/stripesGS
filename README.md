# stripesGS
A case for Bruce keyboard pcb.
Bullet points: designed for mid-pro tecsee switches; non-fixating switch cutouts (so can easily desolder single switches); negative angle; assumed mjf print, so tighter tolerances; integrated thick plate; inspired by a certain well known character.
Bottom cover file is without kerf; assumed 2.55mm plexiglas/acrylic laser-cut plate.
